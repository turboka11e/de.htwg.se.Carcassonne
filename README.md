## Gameplay

In this implementation 1 to 4 players can play.
They each place one card each turn until no cards can be placed on the board anymore.
On every card they place they can put no or exactly one manican on one of the territories (e.g. castle or road) on the card.
Cards can only be put next to another card. For every castle or road closed, players get 2 or 1 points for each card, respectively. The player with the most points wins.
